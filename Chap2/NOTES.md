# Cracking The Coding Interview - Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

## Question 2.1

**Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.**

**FOLLOW UP**
**How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?**

### Ask Questions

 1. Is this a singly or doubly linked list?
 2. What is the data type stored in the nodes?

### Design an Algorithm

 Assume the linked list contains at least 2 nodes (make sure to check the corner cases!).
 For each node iterated, we check from front for duplication. If duplication found, we
 delete the node under inspection.

### Write Pseudocodes

### Write Real Codes

### Test and Fix Bugs

#### Test Cases
