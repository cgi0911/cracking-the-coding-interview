# Cracking The Coding Interview - Chapter 1 - Arrays and Strings

---
## Question 1.1

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?

### Ask Questions

 * Is the string encoded in ASCII?
 * Is this a C-style string (ending with ```\0```, and can be operated upon with ```<string>```)?
 * May I make a copy of the input string?
 * If I have to do it in place, may I change the contents of the buffer?
 * How should the function results defined if the string is an empty string?

### Design an Algorithm

### Write Pseudocodes

### Write Real Codes

### Test and Fix Bugs

 #### Test Cases
 1. Empty string
 2. String with only one char
 3. All-unique char string
 4. All-duplicates string
 5. String with some unique chars and some duplicates
